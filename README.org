I'm Vox, a 20-year old physics major and music minor.

- I'm fascinated by physics; quantum mechanics and General Relativity in particular.
- Been using Linux exclusively since 2020.
- I love worldbuilding/fantasy.
- I'm obsessed with dragons.
- I hope to get into some kind of physics research in the future. ^w^
